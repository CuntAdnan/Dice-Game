A simple dice game between two players based on javascript
In these project we have made two players and assigned an image to them and then we have two random function inbuilt which gives us a number betweeen 1 to 6 and then on the basis of the value of the number we change the image of the dice present on the screen and also output the result on the screen in the heading section
